<h3>What Is Fortnite?</h3>
<hr>


<p>
Fortnite is a popular battle royale game with multiple different game modes, ranging from casual playlists to competitive modes such as Ranked. It is a unique shooter because it includes building mechanics, which allow players to create structures for defense, movement, and strategy.
<br>
For players who prefer gunplay without building, Fortnite also offers a Zero Build mode, making the game accessible to different playstyles. Fortnite is well established in the esports scene, featuring tournaments with large prize pools and professional players.
<br>
The game is free to play and has a steep skill curve, but it is very rewarding once you learn the mechanics. Its constant updates, new seasons, and collaborations keep the gameplay fresh and exciting.

<p>
	Using the right settings can greatly improve performance. It is optimal to play on low graphics settings in 		Fortnite because it helps you spot players more easily, provides smoother gameplay, and results in a better 		overall experience—especially on lower-end PCs.

	Additionally, using Deuteranope color-blind settings is recommended, as it allows you to see more clearly 		inside the storm and improves visibility in many situations.

<p>
I personally use 800 DPI with 6.4 vertical and horizontal sensitivity, along with 150% building and editing speed. I also use custom keybinds, which help me perform better in fights and during fast edits.
<br>
However, sensitivity and keybinds are personal preference, so it’s important to experiment and find settings that feel comfortable and suit your playstyle.
