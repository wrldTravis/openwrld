<h3>Rust </h3>
<hr>
<p>

	Rust is a survival game with a strong PvP focus. The game takes place on a large island where players must 	survive by looting monuments to find guns, gear, and other valuable items. You can also farm materials such 	as wood, stone, and metal to craft weapons, tools, and build your own base.
</p>

<p>
	
	PvP plays a huge role in Rust, as other players are often your biggest threat. Raiding, base defense, and 	gunfights are a core part of the experience. While Rust doesn’t have a traditional competitive or ranked 	system, it has a massive skill curve. Players who invest time into learning recoil control, positioning, and 	game sense have a big advantage, which makes the game very rewarding to master. Overall, Rust is a 	challenging but extremely fun survival game.

<h3> Settings </h3>
<hr>
<p>

	I mainly play on all low graphics settings. Lower settings make it easier to spot players, especially at long 	distances, and they also significantly improve performance. Higher frames per second (FPS) make the game feel 	smoother and more responsive, which is very important in PvP situations. Because of this, I keep all graphics 	settings on low for maximum visibility and performance.
</p>

<p>
I also use a custom crosshair, which helps with aiming consistency and makes it easier to track targets during fights.



Sensitivity Settings
<br>

For sensitivity, I use:
<ul>
	<li> DPI: 800/li>
	<li>In-game sensitivity: 0.225</li>
	<li>ADS sensitivity: 0.8</li>

</ul>
