<h3>What Is Valorant? </h3>
<hr>
<p>

Valorant is a competitive 5v5 first-person shooter developed by Riot Games. The game features multiple game modes, with the main focus being the tactical ranked mode. Valorant is often compared to a mix of CS:GO and Overwatch, combining precise gunplay and positioning with unique agent abilities.
<br><br>


While each agent has special abilities, Valorant is still heavily based on aim, crosshair placement, positioning, and teamwork. Good game sense and communication are just as important as mechanical skill. Valorant also has a strong competitive scene, with a ranked ladder and a well-established esports ecosystem, making it one of the most competitive FPS games available.

<h3>My Settings </h3>
<hr>

I play on low graphics settings in Valorant. Lower settings make it easier to spot enemies at long distances and reduce visual clutter from effects and shadows. This also helps maintain high and stable FPS, which is important for smooth gameplay and quick reactions in competitive matches.
<br><br>

Sensitivity Settings

<ul> 
	<li> My sensitivity setup is:
	<li> DPI: 800
	<li> In-game sensitivity: 0.508
</ul> 

This sensitivity gives me a good balance between precise aiming for long-range fights and fast movement for close-quarters engagements.
