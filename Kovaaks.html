<h3> DPI Settings </h3>

	<p>
	I play on 800 DPI, and I recommend using 800 or 1600 DPI, as these generally provide the lowest input delay and the most consistent sensor performance on modern mice.It’s also important to use the same sensitivity across all games whenever possible. This helps build stronger muscle memory, making your aim more consistent and transferable between games.

	<b>The main maps I use to train my aim are:</b>
	<br>
	<b>3x3 Gridshot Frenzy</b> – great for improving flicking speed, precision, and target switching.
	<br>
	<b>360° Tracking Frenzy maps</b> – excellent for tracking fast and unpredictable targets. Any 360 tracking scenario works well depending on your skill level.
	<br>
	These maps focus on the core aiming mechanics needed for most FPS games.

Kovaak’s FPS Aim Trainer is a performance-based aim training tool designed to improve mechanical aim skills. It records detailed statistics such as accuracy, score, reaction time, and consistency, allowing you to track your improvement over time.

You can get Kovaak’s on Steam, and it costs around €7. It includes:
<ul>
<b>Hundreds of community-made maps</b>
<b>Game-specific playlists for titles like Valorant, CS2, Apex Legends, and more</b>

</ul>
Leaderboards to compare your performance with other players, Structured routines used by many professional FPS players. I highly recommend Kovaak’s over other aim trainers, as it offers more depth, better customization, and proven results. Many top-tier players use it as part of their daily training routine.
